        <p>
          I am a Web Developer with a Master's Degree in Front-End Development.
          <br />
          Currently, I am seeking full-time employment.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am motivated and hardworking, driven by the prospects of learning
          new approaches and technologies and always open to new problem-solving
          techniques.
          <br />
          <br />
          My peers describe me as someone who can work efficiently by myself
          while maintaining focus and organisation. However, I enjoy working in
          a team, distributing the tasks between the members for the most
          efficient solutions.
