        <p>
          Hello! My name is Kate and I am a recent postgraduate seeking
          employment. <br />
          I am a motivated and hardworking student with a professional and
          educational background in both Marketing and Computer Science. <br />
          I am highly driven by the prospects of learning new approaches and
          technologies, always open to new problem-solving techniques. <br />
          I am a team player while being able to work efficiently by myself,
          maintaining focus and organisation. <br />
          <br />
          Please, don't hesitate to get in touch in case you have any questions!
